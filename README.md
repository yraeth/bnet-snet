# Building and Settlement Networks (bnet-snet)

Welcome to the **bnet-snet** GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of codes designed to create, delineate, and analyze building (bnet) and settlement (snet) networks. The code requires building footprint data, as polygons, and a road network with travel speeds. 

## Overview

The workflow for using these codes is as follows:

1. Create building networks (BNCreation.py)
2. Delineate settlements (BNtoiGraph.R)
3. Calculate settlement networks (CalculateTravelTimes, SNShpCreation.py)
4. Conduct analysis (SettlementRelationshipTypes.R, SettlementStatistics.R, FractalDimension.py, StatisticalAnalysis.R)

## Usage

To use the codes in this repository, follow the steps listed in the overview.
